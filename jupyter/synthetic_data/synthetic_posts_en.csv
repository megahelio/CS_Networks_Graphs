"The impact of global warming on marine ecosystems is profound and multifaceted, threatening biodiversity worldwide. Increased sea temperatures can lead to coral bleaching events, where colorful algae that provide vital nutrients to corals are expelled from their tissues as water warms beyond 1°C above normal levels. This phenomenon not only damages these delicate organisms but also disrupts critical food webs, affecting countless species dependent upon healthy reefs for survival.

Moreover, rising ocean acidity due to increased carbon dioxide absorption contributes significantly to acidification. This condition makes it harder for shell-forming creatures like mollusks and crustaceans to build calcium carbonate structures, impacting their ability to thrive and reproduce effectively. The combined effects of warmer waters and altered pH levels threaten a range of marine life globally, with far-reaching consequences for human societies reliant on oceans for resources such as fisheries, coastal protection, and tourism.
