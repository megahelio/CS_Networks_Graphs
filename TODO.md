- [x] Be able to search for a set of posts based on defined keywords.
    - [x] Set a specific ammount of posts by keyword to be retrieved

- [x] Be able  build a weighted graph that relates posts based on the keywords they contain. On this graph, we want to calculate the following metrics:

    Locals:
    - [x] For local measures, a distribution will be shown.
    - [x] Degree distribution
    - [X] Strength distribution
    - [x] Betweenness centrality
    - [X] Closeness centrality
    
    Globals:
    - [x] Global clustering
    - [x] Community modularity
    - [x] Average strength
    - [X] Average degree
    - [x] Graph diameter
    - [x] Graph density
    
    - [ ] Clusters (for measure)

- [x] We like the graph style

Choose one of the following options (or both :P):

    - [ ] We want to use an LLM to generate posts based on the original keywords and compare them with the previous set.

    - [x] We want to compare results between diferent countries/languages.

- [ ] Write some conclusions.


- [X] hacer el grafo circular, para que se lea mejor (como el otro grupo)
- [X] Add weights to the graph (co-occurrence)
