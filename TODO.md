- [x] Be able to search for a set of posts based on defined keywords.
    - [ ] Set a specific ammount of posts by keyword to be retrieved

- [x] Be able  build a weighted graph that relates posts based on the keywords they contain. On this graph, we want to calculate the following metrics (we have to check this):

    - [ ] Degree distribution
    - [ ] Average degree
    - [ ] Strength distribution
    - [ ] Average strength
    - [ ] Betweenness centrality
    - [ ] Closeness centrality
    - [ ] Graph density
    - [ ] Global clustering
    - [ ] Graph diameter
    - [ ] Community modularity
    - [ ] Clusters (for measure)

    - [ ] For local measures, a distribution will be shown.

- [ ] We like the graph style

Choose one of the following options (or both :P):

    - [ ] We want to use an LLM to generate posts based on the original keywords and compare them with the previous set.

    - [ ] We want to compare results between diferent countries/languages.

- [ ] Write some conclusions.
